# TopThis Current State

TopThis is a strategic multiplayer card game where every card has its own
counters, and the last successful play takes the pile.

## Status

- Active phase: Phase 2 — complete practice game (planning)
- Last completed phase: Phase 1 — card content and deterministic engine
- Last pushed phase commit: `4f6b39d` (Phase 0)
- Runtime: Node.js 24.18.0 and pnpm 11.14.0
- Windows note: use `pnpm.cmd` when a local PowerShell execution policy blocks
  the unsigned `pnpm.ps1` shim; root package scripts remain cross-platform.
- External blockers: none

## Phase 0 delegation ledger

### SOL DECISIONS

- Use a strict TypeScript pnpm workspace with `apps/web`, `apps/server`,
  `packages/game-engine`, and `packages/shared` boundaries.
- Keep the game engine deterministic and dependency-free; network schemas and
  recipient-safe public state belong in `@topthis/shared`.
- Run one Fastify process with Socket.IO; in production it will serve the Vite
  client build, while development may run the Vite and server processes through
  one root command.
- Treat the server as the only authority for identity, hidden hands, commands,
  turns, scoring, timeouts, persistence, and rating application.
- Use Zod at process boundaries. SQLite selection and persistence design are
  deferred to the persistence phase after Node 24 compatibility is verified.
- Use Vitest for package/server tests and Playwright for browser flows. CI will
  execute install, format checking, linting, type checking, tests, and builds.
- The MVP is single-instance. Horizontal scaling is explicitly out of scope and
  would require shared active-match state plus a Socket.IO adapter.

### TERRA TASKS

- Own `packages/shared/**` and `apps/server/**` for Phase 0.
- Implement the initial validated shared schemas and a blank branded
  Fastify/Socket.IO server with a health endpoint and production static-client
  hook consistent with the decided boundaries.
- Add focused tests for shared schemas and server startup/health behavior.
- Do not edit root workspace configuration, `apps/web/**`, documentation, or CI.
- Definition of done: both packages are strict TypeScript, build and typecheck;
  malformed boundary input is rejected; server health tests pass.
- Verification: `pnpm.cmd --filter @topthis/shared test && pnpm.cmd --filter
@topthis/server test` plus filtered type checking.

### LUNA TASKS

- Own root workspace/tooling files, `apps/web/**`, `packages/game-engine/**`
  Phase 0 placeholder only, `.github/workflows/**`, `README.md`, and the Phase 0
  documents other than this ledger.
- Scaffold the pnpm monorepo, strict shared TypeScript settings, ESLint,
  Prettier, Vitest/Playwright configuration, branded blank React client, pure
  game-engine package boundary, root scripts, initial CI, and required docs.
- Do not implement game rules, server behavior, shared schemas, or edit
  `docs/CURRENT_STATE.md`.
- Definition of done: root install and scripts are coherent; the blank TopThis
  client builds and its smoke test passes; all required Phase 0 documents exist
  and accurately describe the decided architecture without claiming later
  features exist.
- Verification: `pnpm.cmd install`, then filtered web/game-engine build, test,
  and typecheck commands; run format checking for owned files.

### TOO SMALL TO DELEGATE

- Record runtime/model/config verification in this ledger.
- Review worker diffs for boundary violations and integration conflicts.
- Apply tiny integration corrections that do not constitute routine feature
  implementation.
- Run the integrated Phase 0 verification matrix, open the blank application in
  the built-in Browser, update worker records, and commit the passing phase.

## Worker records

`worker | task | result | verification`

- `terra_worker | Phase 0 shared schemas and Fastify/Socket.IO server | passed;
one dev-runner correction replaced incompatible native type stripping with
tsx | shared/server tests, typecheck, build, lint, live /health request`
- `luna_worker | Phase 0 workspace, web shell, engine boundary, CI and docs |
passed after correcting pnpm build policy, official branding, artwork docs,
stale E2E copy, IPv4 dev binding and visually observed responsive clipping |
install, filtered tests/build/typecheck, Playwright desktop/mobile smoke`
- `terra_worker | Phase 1 deterministic engine | core implementation retained;
after two attempts still had setup/refill/package and coverage gaps, so Sol
performed the policy-authorized focused takeover | worker 9 tests; integrated
engine 25 tests plus build/typecheck/lint`
- `luna_worker | Phase 1 authored/resolved content and rules docs | resolved
catalog retained; after two attempts authored tag expansion and rule text were
still incomplete, so Sol performed the policy-authorized focused takeover |
independent 23-definition/400-copy resolution check and engine content tests`

## Phase 0 verification

- Root install, build, unit/integration tests, type checking, linting and
  formatting checks pass.
- `pnpm.cmd dev` starts Vite on `127.0.0.1:5173` and TopThis Server on port
  3000; `/health` returns the validated service response.
- Playwright launches Chromium and passes the landing-page smoke flow.
- Built-in Browser inspection passed at the default desktop viewport and at
  390x844. The first inspection found a clipped oversized headline; the CSS was
  corrected and reverified with all content visible and no horizontal overflow.

## Phase 1 delegation ledger

### SOL DECISIONS

- Commit both `content/cards.authored.json` and the resolved runtime artifact
  `content/cards.json`. Authoring-only tag relationships expand into validated,
  explicit `beatsDefinitionIds`; runtime legality never interprets tags or
  compares rarity.
- Use 23 manageable definitions: all required definitions plus provisional Ice,
  Lightning and Plant. The committed master-pool copy counts total exactly 400,
  with exactly four Tornados and one Meteor.
- Classify Mouse, Cat and Dog as animals; classify those three plus Plant as
  living creatures. Gun therefore resolves against every living-creature ID,
  while every Fire definition resolves against every animal ID.
- Treat input definition order as non-authoritative. Master-pool construction
  sorts by definition ID and assigns deterministic instance IDs of the form
  `<definition-id>#<one-based-copy-number>`.
- Use an engine-owned seeded PRNG and Fisher-Yates shuffle. Match creation builds
  all 400 instances, shuffles once from the match seed, selects the first 200
  without replacement, then uses deterministic random state for leader choice.
- Initial and refill dealing are round-robin. Refill proceeds one card at a time
  clockwise beginning with the round winner until hands reach ten or the deck is
  exhausted; no hidden global randomness or wall-clock time enters the engine.
- The engine owns full secret match state but no recipient serialization. A
  round ends into an explicit `round_result` phase; an internal validated
  `advanceRound` command either starts the next round or completes the match.
- Every state-changing command carries a command ID, match ID, expected state
  version and expected turn ID where applicable. First acceptance wins races;
  duplicate/stale/old-turn commands are deterministic no-ops with typed errors.
- Replay consists of creation input plus the accepted command log. Replaying the
  log must reconstruct an identical deterministic state.

### TERRA TASKS

- Own `packages/game-engine/**` for Phase 1.
- Implement dependency-free strict TypeScript content types/validation and
  authoring resolution, seeded randomization, master-pool/match-deck creation,
  full two-to-four-player match state, play/skip/timeout/advance transitions,
  round scoring/refill/end/ties, idempotency/stale-turn protection, command log
  and replay under the semantics above.
- Add comprehensive Vitest coverage for required relationships and all engine
  completion criteria, importing content artifacts only from tests; production
  engine code must not access the filesystem or depend on React/server/network/
  database/browser/wall-clock/global randomness.
- Do not edit `content/**`, docs, apps, shared, or root tooling except the engine
  package manifest if strictly required. Do not spawn subagents or broaden into
  bots/networking.
- Definition of done: all Phase 1 engine operations are deterministic, all
  specified invalid commands are rejected without mutation, complete rounds and
  matches work for 2/3/4 players, and deterministic replay is byte-equivalent
  under stable serialization.
- Verification: `pnpm.cmd --filter @topthis/game-engine test`, build and
  typecheck, plus `pnpm.cmd lint` scoped to the engine.

### LUNA TASKS

- Own `content/**`, `docs/CARD_CONTENT.md`, `docs/GAME_RULES.md` and content-only
  tests/fixtures if they do not overlap Terra's engine files.
- Create authored and resolved JSON for the 23 decided definitions, including
  exact required Water/Fire and named relationships, tag expansion intent,
  explicit resolved IDs, icon paths and copy counts totaling 400. Document every
  provisional card and matchup, full rules/edge cases, content-resolution
  workflow and validation invariants.
- Do not edit the engine, apps, shared, root tooling, or this current-state file.
  Do not spawn subagents. Coordinate with the committed engine API only through
  data shapes defined in this ledger; do not invent runtime rule semantics.
- Definition of done: JSON is valid and internally consistent; all required
  definitions/fields/relationships exist; Tornado/Meteor and pool totals are
  exact; provisional content is fully documented.
- Verification: a focused Node JSON parse/count/reference script, Prettier check,
  and the engine content tests once available.

### TOO SMALL TO DELEGATE

- Review resolved relationships and copy-count arithmetic against the product
  brief, integrate worker results, and decide any genuine semantic ambiguity.
- Apply tiny package/export/script corrections needed to integrate the two
  non-overlapping contributions.
- Run the complete Phase 1 gate, update worker records and commit/push the
  passing phase. Phase 1 adds no new browser UI, so visual verification remains
  the already-passing Phase 0 shell.

## Phase 1 verification

- The authored 23-definition catalog resolves exactly to the committed explicit
  runtime catalog. The master pool has 400 unique instances, four Tornados and
  one Meteor; fixed seeds cover selected decks with Meteor present and absent.
- Runtime legality is a direct explicit-ID membership check. Exact Water/Fire,
  living-creature, animal, named, provisional, Tornado and Meteor relationships
  are covered without any rarity comparison.
- Deterministic setup, two/three/four-player passes, latest-player round wins,
  pile scoring, refill order, target/deck completion, ties, invalid commands,
  timeout races and byte-equivalent replay are covered by 25 engine tests.
- `@topthis/game-engine` emits importable JavaScript and declarations while
  retaining no runtime dependency, I/O, wall-clock or global-randomness access.
- Full workspace tests, build, type checking, Playwright and formatting pass.
  Lint passes after ignoring transient Playwright artifacts; the initial
  concurrent lint/E2E run exposed and fixed that generated-directory race.

## Remaining non-blocking limitations

- The deterministic card/rules foundation is complete. Practice bots and the
  complete game table, private multiplayer, persistence, matchmaking, ratings,
  leaderboard and final product polish remain for Phases 2 through 5.
